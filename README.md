# features
- walk around a simple map with a cool skybox
- whizz a ball around, see its velocity and force vectors in real time
- too fast? slow down time, or heck, even stop it entirely
- use the data tablet to get the exact values, use them to model situations and learn about physics

# inspo
- didnt want to build anything physical for my physics summative (buy materials, store, etc)
- wanted to learn how to work with vr

# shoutouts / resources
- used this guys (the goat btw) template to get the vr export template: https://soapspangledgames.com/godot/BasicVR.zip
- xr toolkit was an addon i used, got in on godot's assetlib page
- cool guy on yt helped with learning / implementing a bunch of features in vr: https://www.youtube.com/@MuddyWolf
